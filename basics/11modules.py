# instead of one big software - break it down in small small parts = components
# lets say for four functionality - four modules - A B C D - if we change in one, wont affect other
# adv - reusability, loose coupling
# need of modules - 

# for example - calc module will have four function - add sub div mul
# to use - import module

# for example  -  from numpy import *
