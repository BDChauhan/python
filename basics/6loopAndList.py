# Rules for if-statements
# 1. Every if-statement must have an else.
# 2. If this else should never run because it doesnâ€™t make sense, then you
# must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and
# dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This will find many errors.
# 3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do
# them one deep.
# 4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else
# grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
# 5. Your Boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their
# calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for
# the variable. 


# break - to exit from loop
# continue - go to beginning of loop
# pass - to execute nothing

# list(mutable) vs tuple(immutable)
